## Cousera Deep Learning

I learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. I learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. I master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. All these ideas are practiced in Python and in TensorFlow.
