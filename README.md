## Cousera Deep Learning

I learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. I learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. I master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. All these ideas are practiced in Python and in TensorFlow.

This program consists of five courses:

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models

### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In this course, I learn the foundations of deep learning:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course teaches how Deep Learning actually works.
